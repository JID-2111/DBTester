# Description

## Link to the issue you are closing

Fixes # (issue)

## Screenshot or other testing that you have completed

Your PR should include at least one test/screenshot in order to showcase that the changes don't break/fix what was needed. In the case of frontend, a screenshot should suffice. For backend, depending on the scenario, some temporary tests may need to be written to show that the function does what's needed.
